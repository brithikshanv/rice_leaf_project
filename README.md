# Rice Leaf Disease Detection 🌾

## Problem Statement
Build a machine learning model to classify major rice leaf diseases using image data.

## Tasks
- **Task 1:** Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset  
- **Task 2:** Build models to classify rice leaf diseases  
- **Task 3:** Analyze techniques such as data augmentation and compare model performance  

## Dataset
- **Total Images:** 120 JPG images  
- **Classes (40 images each):**
  - Leaf smut
  - Brown spot
  - Bacterial leaf blight

> Dataset is not included in this repository due to size constraints.

## Approach
- Image preprocessing and visualization
- Data augmentation techniques
- CNN-based models and model comparison
- Performance evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Model Comparison
Multiple models were trained and evaluated.  
The best-performing model is recommended for production based on overall performance.

## Challenges Faced
- Limited dataset size
- Risk of overfitting
- Class similarity between diseases  

Appropriate preprocessing and augmentation techniques were applied to address these challenges.

## Note
All tasks and analysis are implemented in a **single Jupyter Notebook** as required.
